### A React website by David Sterry 
Initialized on 02/12/21
Last updated on 02/12/21

## üìñ  Description
Jean Claude Van Damme has launched a new Belegian Beer Tap room in Portland. He needed a website to help keep track of his kegs. This site lets him create, update, delete kegs, as well as keep track of how many beers are in an individual keg. 

## **User Stories**
* Jean Claude should be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete Kegs for his tap room
* Jean Claude should be able to decrease the quantity of beer in an individual keg as he pours beers for customers. 
* When a keg reaches 0, indicating there are no more beers left it should say "The Keg is empty" And Jean Claude should not be able to reduce the amount of beers in the keg below 0

## **Stretch Goals
* Custom styling. Jean Claude really wants this site to reflect his former career
